These projects use the following python libraries:-
1. cv2 (OpenCV):
   - What it does: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library used for computer vision and image processing tasks.
   - Example use: It helps you work with images, videos, and perform operations like face detection, image recognition, and more.

2. time:
   - What it does: The `time` library provides functions to work with time, such as getting the current time or delaying program execution.
   - Example use: You can use it to measure the time your program takes to run certain operations.

3. numpy:
   - What it does: NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library for numerical operations, especially when dealing with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
   - Example use: Useful for mathematical and logical operations on arrays, which can be crucial in scientific computing.

4. HandTrackingModule:
   - What it does: This seems like a custom or external module for hand tracking, likely used to detect and track hand movements or gestures in applications.
   - Example use: It could be used in applications like virtual reality, sign language recognition, or gesture-controlled interfaces.

5. math:
   - What it does: The `math` library provides mathematical functions and constants like sin, cos, sqrt, etc.
   - Example use: You can use it for various mathematical calculations in your program.

6. ctypes with `cast` and `POINTER`:
   - What it does: `ctypes` is a library for calling functions in shared libraries written in C. `cast` and `POINTER` are used to work with C data types in Python.
   - Example use: When you need to interface with C libraries from Python and work with C data types.

7. comtypes with `CLSCTX_ALL`:
   - What it does: `comtypes` is a library for working with COM (Component Object Model) objects in Windows. `CLSCTX_ALL` is a constant indicating all possible contexts.
   - Example use: Useful when interacting with Windows-specific components or applications.

8. pycaw.pycaw with `AudioUtilities` and `IAudioEndpointVolume`:
   - What it does: This library likely deals with audio management on Windows, providing access to audio devices and volumes.
   - Example use: Used to control audio settings programmatically, like adjusting volume or selecting audio devices.

9. screen_brightness_control:
   - What it does: A library for controlling screen brightness on various platforms (Windows, Linux, etc.).
   - Example use: You can use it to adjust the brightness of the screen programmatically.
